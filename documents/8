Earth experiences around 1.4 billion lightning strikes per year, averaging 44 strikes per second. A single bolt of lightning can reach temperatures of 30,000 Kelvin, five times hotter than the surface of the Sun. The most lightning-prone location on Earth is Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, with nearly constant storms.
