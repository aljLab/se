The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each forming thousands of connections. It generates about 20 watts of electrical power, enough to power a small light bulb. The brainâ€™s storage capacity is estimated to be around 2.5 petabytes, equivalent to about three million hours of television recordings.
