The Mariana Trench, in the Pacific Ocean, is the deepest oceanic trench, reaching approximately 10,994 meters at Challenger Deep. At this depth, the pressure is over 1,000 times that at sea level. Few organisms can survive there, but some extremophiles, such as amphipods and snailfish, have adapted to the conditions.
